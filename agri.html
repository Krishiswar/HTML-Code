<p><strong><em>Coconut farmers in Coimbatore told to focus on value addition</em></strong></p>
<p>Coconut farmers should focus on value addition to realise better prices for the produce, said District Collector Kranthi Kumar Pati here on Saturday.

<br>Under the Dr. Kalaignar’s All Village Integrated Agriculture Development Programme in Coimbatore district, about 27,600 coconut saplings are distributed at ₹16.56 lakhs to 46 panchayat farmers. Further, 40 demonstration projects will be implemented at farms at ₹ 24.50 lakhs from the Coconut Development Board, he said.
